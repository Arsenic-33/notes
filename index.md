# CS1S Notes (Sigma 16)
## Lecture 7 (First)
### Structure of Registers
The RTM circuit has 4 (R0, …, R3), each holding 4 bits 
There are 16 registers in Sigma16, each holding 16 bits (a
16-bit word) [^1]  

### RTM Instructions
The RTM circuit can execute only two instructions  
```
R2 := R1 + R0 ; add two registers and load result
R1 := 8 ; load a constant
```
### Add instructions
The add instruction  
• Examples  
```
add R5,R2,R3 ; means R5 := R2 + R3
add R12,R1,R7 ; means R12 := R1 + R7
```
• General form
`add dest,op1,op2 ` *where dest, op1, op2 are registers*  
**The two operands are added, the result is placed in the destination**  
*Meaning:* `dest := op1 + op2`  
---------------------
### Register R0 and R15 are special!
• **You should not use R0 or R15 to hold ordinary variables!**  
• **R0 always contains 0**  
– Any time you need the number 0, it's available in R0  
– You cannot change the value of R0  
– It is legal to use R0 as the destination, but it will still be 0 after you do it!  
– `add R0,R2,R3` ; does nothing (R0 will not change)  
• ** R15 holds status information**  
– Some instructions place additional information in R15 (is the result
negative? was there an overflow?)  
– Therefore, R15 is for temporary information (not a safe place to keep
long-term data)  

### Registers and memory
• Register file  
– 16 registers (too small to hold all your variables)  
– Each register holds a 16-bit word  
– Names are R0, R1, R2, ..., R15  
– You can do arithmetic on data in the registers  
– Use registers to hold data temporarily that you're doing arithmetic on  
• Memory  
– 65,536 memory locations  
– Each memory location holds a 16-bit word  
– Each memory location has an address 0, 1, 2, …, 65,535  
– The machine cannot do arithmetic on a memory location  
– Use memory locations to store program variables and the program itself  

### Copying a word between memory and register
• There are two instructions for accessing the memory  
– load copies a variable from memory to a register  
• `load R2,x[R0]` copies the variable x from memory to register R2  
• `R2 := x`  
• R2 is changed; x is unchanged  
– store copies a variable from a register to memory  
• `store R3,y[R0]` copies the word in register R3 to variable y in memory  
• `y := R3`  
• y is changed; R3 is unchanged  

### An assignment statement in assembly language
• High-level language statement  
`x := a+b+c`  
• Assembly language  
```
load R1,a[R0] ; R1 := a
load R2,b[R0] ; R2 := b
add R3,R1,R2 ; R3 := a+b
load R4,c[R0] ; R4 := c
add R5,R3,R4 ; R5 := (a+b) + c
store R5,x[R0] ; x := a+b+c
```
• Use load to copy variables from memory to registers  
• Do arithmetic with add, sub, mul, div  
• Use store to copy result back to memory
