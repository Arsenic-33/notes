# CS1S Notes (Sigma 16)
## Lecture 7 (First)
### Structure of Registers
The RTM circuit has 4 (R0, …, R3), each holding 4 bits 
There are 16 registers in Sigma16, each holding 16 bits (a
16-bit word) [^1]

### RTM Instructions
The RTM circuit can execute only two instructions
```
R2 := R1 + R0 ; add two registers and load result
R1 := 8 ; load a constant
```
### Add instructions
The add instruction
• Examples
```
add R5,R2,R3 ; means R5 := R2 + R3
add R12,R1,R7 ; means R12 := R1 + R7
```
• General form
```
add dest,op1,op2 ```*where dest, op1, op2 are registers*
**The two operands are added, the result is placed in the destination**
*Meaning:* ```dest := op1 + op2
```

### Register R0 and R15 are special!
• **You should not use R0 or R15 to hold ordinary variables!**
• **R0 always contains 0**
– Any time you need the number 0, it's available in R0
– You cannot change the value of R0
– It is legal to use R0 as the destination, but it will still be 0 after you do it!
– add R0,R2,R3 ; does nothing (R0 will not change)
•** R15 holds status information**
– Some instructions place additional information in R15 (is the result
negative? was there an overflow?)
– Therefore, R15 is for temporary information (not a safe place to keep
long-term data)


[^1]: Each 16-bit register is 16 copies of the reg1 circuit
